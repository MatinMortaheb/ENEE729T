# Critical Review on the Effect of Different Metrics in Information Theoretic Privacy
In the context of privacy, there is a trade-off between the utility and privacy of the published dataset. To obtain better privacy-utility tradeoff, two randomized-based approaches have been proposed in literature. (1) is context-free approaches that assume worst-case dataset statistics and adversaries. The most famous context-free approach is Differential Privacy (DP). (2) is context-aware approaches that explicitly model the dataset statistics and adversaryâ€™s capabilities. Compared to the context-free privacy notions, context-aware privacy notions achieve a better privacy-utility tradeoff by incorporating the statistics of the dataset and placing reasonable restrictions on the capabilities of the adversary. Our goal for the project is to do a critical review on context-aware methods which is also known as information theoretic privacy. In the information theoretic method, utility and privacy constraints can be defined with various metrics such as mutual information, minimum mean square error, and maximal correlation. We tried to critically investigate the advantages and deficiencies of each metrics by comparing their lower-bound and privacy leakage separately for discrete and continuous case. Our review shows that mutual information sacrifices privacy to reach better utility. On the other hand, maximal correlation will behave better from the privacy point of view.
